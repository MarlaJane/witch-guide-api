This api is a guide to monthly information regarding witch practice.

Simple info: months.js
More to come: working folder

This is an api relating the month to it's placement on the wheel of the year.

I am an idiot and this keeps changing but, I will hopefully be able to settle down and have it make sense?

Festivals? Seasons? Rituals? Practices? Purpose?
Like, what am I trying to include? 

I am going to say my goal is to create a database of monthly ritual magic tools. It is just going to take a bit.
